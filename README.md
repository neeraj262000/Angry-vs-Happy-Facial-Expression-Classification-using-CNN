# Angry-vs-Happy-Facial-Expression-Classification-using-CNN
This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying facial expressions into two categories: **Angry** and **Happy**. It utilizes image data, processes it using deep learning techniques, and evaluates the model's performance using relevant metrics.
